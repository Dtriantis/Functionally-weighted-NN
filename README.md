# Functionally weighted Convolutional Neural Networks

This thesis was a part of my MSc.
In this repo you will find code which was written for the experiments and the full thesis report

## Quick Summary
In this thesis we introduce a new convolutional model where the weights are functions of a continuous variable, instead of a discrete indexed kernels. 
Consequently, we create an infinite size kernel for the convolutional layer, thus we obtain infinite feature maps as the output of the layer which become an integral over the introduced continuous variable.
The gain is a drastic reduction of parameteres, accompanied by a superior generalization performance. 
To evaluate the quality of this new network, we conducted a series of experiments among some established computer vision datasets obtaining some very promising results.
